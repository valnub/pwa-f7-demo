# pwa-f7-demo

This is the source code for my [PWA video on YouTube](https://youtu.be/8InXvCzt4-M) in which I will explain how to make a PWA installable and benefit from its offline caching capabilities.

## How to use

* `npm install` - install deps
* `npm start` - run development server
* `npm run build-prod` - build web app for production
* `npm run build-dev` - build web app using development mode (faster build without minification and optimization)
