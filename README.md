# pwa-f7-demo

This is the source code for my PWA video on YouTube in which I will explain how to make a PWA installable and benefit from its offline caching capabilities.

## NPM Scripts

* `npm start` - run development server
* `npm run build-prod` - build web app for production
* `npm run build-dev` - build web app using development mode (faster build without minification and optimization)
